# Introduction To Generative AI

### What is GenAI?

Generative AI (GenAI) is a specialized area within AI and ML that involves creating models capable of generating new data that mimics the structure and distribution of the training data. Unlike traditional AI models that focus on classification or prediction, `GenAI models are designed to create new content, such as text, images, music, and more, making them particularly powerful in creative and content-driven applications.`

### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

*Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence*. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, and perceiving the environment.

### What is Machine Learning?

*Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed for each task*. ML algorithms build models based on sample data, known as "training data," to make predictions or decisions without being specifically coded to perform the task. ML is the foundation upon which many AI systems are built, including those in GenAI.



#### 1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a crucial technique in machine learning where models are trained on labeled data. In GenAI, supervised learning helps the model understand the relationship between inputs and desired outputs, such as generating specific types of content based on given prompts.

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning deals with training models on data that isn't labeled. This technique allows GenAI models to discover patterns or groupings within the data, which can then be used to generate new, similar data. 

#### 3. Discriminative Models
Discriminative models are designed to distinguish between different classes or outcomes, focusing on predicting labels for given inputs. While they aren't generative themselves, discriminative models are often used alongside generative models to improve the accuracy of content generation, such as in the discriminator component of GANs.

#### 4. Generative Models
Generative models are the heart of GenAI, designed to learn the underlying distribution of a dataset and generate new data points that resemble the original data. These models can create realistic images, text, or other content types.


## Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Integration
GCP provides powerful tools and infrastructure for developing and deploying GenAI models. With services like AutoML, BigQuery ML, and the AI Platform, GCP supports the entire lifecycle of GenAI projects, from model training to large-scale deployment. GCP's integration with TensorFlow and its robust data processing capabilities make it an ideal platform for scaling GenAI applications.
