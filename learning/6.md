# Gemini For Application Developers

**In this you will learn how to use Gemini for Application Development and Deployment.**

### **Setup**
1. **Sign In to Qwiklabs:**
   - Use an incognito window and lab credentials.

2. **Activate Cloud Shell:**
   - Click the Activate Cloud Shell button.
   - Run sample commands to check account and project ID.

### **Task 1: Configure Your Environment and Account**
1. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
   REGION=set at lab start
   echo "PROJECT_ID=${PROJECT_ID}"
   echo "REGION=${REGION}"
   ```

2. **Store User Account:**
   ```bash
   USER=$(gcloud config get-value account 2> /dev/null)
   echo "USER=${USER}"
   ```

3. **Enable Cloud AI Companion API:**
   ```bash
   gcloud services enable cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com --project ${PROJECT_ID}
   ```

4. **Grant IAM Roles:**
   ```bash
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member user:${USER} --role=roles/cloudaicompanion.user
   gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member user:${USER} --role=roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageViewer
   ```

### **Task 2: Create a Cloud Workstation**
1. **View Workstation Cluster:**
   - Go to **View All Products > Tools > Cloud Workstations**.
   - Check cluster status and wait until it's ready.

2. **Create Workstation Configuration:**
   - Navigate to **Workstation configurations** and click **Create Workstation Configuration**.
   - Set properties: 
     - Name: `my-config`
     - Workstation cluster: `my-cluster`
   - Click **Create** and wait for status to be **Ready**.

3. **Create a Workstation:**
   - Go to **Workstations** and click **Create Workstation**.
   - Set properties:
     - Name: `my-workstation`
     - Configuration: `my-config`
   - Click **Create** and wait until status is **Running**.
   - Click **Start** and wait for it to become **Running**.

4. **Launch the IDE:**
   - Enable third-party cookies in Chrome.
   - Click **Launch** from the Workstations page to open the IDE.

### **Task 3: Update the Cloud Code Extension to Enable Gemini**
1. **Connect to Google Cloud:**
   - Click **Cloud Code - Sign In** in the IDE status bar.
   - Follow the sign-in instructions and copy the authorization code into the terminal.

2. **Enable Gemini in Cloud Code:**
   - Go to **File > Preferences > Settings**.
   - Search for Gemini and set:
     - `Cloudcode > Duet AI: Project`: Paste your project ID.
     - Confirm `Cloud Code > Duet AI: Enable` is enabled.

### **Task 4: Chat with Gemini**
1. **Prompt Gemini for Help:**
   - Open the Gemini Code Assist pane.
   - Type prompts like:
     - "I am new to Google Cloud and I want to use the Cloud Code extension. Give me some examples of Google services that I can use to build and deploy a sample app."
     - "What is the difference between Cloud Run and Cloud Functions?"

### **Task 5: Develop a Python App**
1. **Get Help from Gemini:**
   - Prompt Gemini: "How do I create a new Cloud Run app in Cloud Code using the command palette? What languages are supported?"

2. **Create a Python App:**
   - Use the command palette to select **Cloud Code: New Application**.
   - Choose **Cloud Run application** and **Python (Flask)**.

3. **Run the App Locally:**
   - Click **Cloud Code** > **Run App on Local Cloud Run Emulator**.
   - Wait for build and deploy to complete.
   - Check the app at the localhost URL.

### **Task 6: Enhance the Python App**
1. **Generate Sample Data:**
   - Create a file named `inventory.py` and prompt Gemini to generate inventory data.

2. **Add API Methods:**
   - Modify `app.py` to include:
     - GET `/inventory` to list inventory items.
     - GET `/inventory/<productid>` to get specific item details.

Hereâ€™s the updated lab with Task 7 included:


### **Task 7. Deploy the app to Cloud Run**
- Open the Command Palette in Visual Studio Code (Code OSS) by clicking `View` > `Command Palette`.
- Type `Cloud Code Deploy` in the command palette field and select `Cloud Code: Deploy to Cloud Run` from the list.
- To enable the Cloud Run API for your project, click `Enable API`.
- On the Service Settings page, select the region set at the start of the lab for the `Region` setting.
- Leave the remaining settings as their defaults and click `Deploy`.
- Cloud Code will build your image, push it to the registry, and deploy your service to Cloud Run. This may take a few minutes.
  - **Note:** To view detailed logs for the deployment, click `Show Detailed Logs`.
- Once deployed, view your running service by opening the URL displayed in the `Deploy to Cloud Run` dialog.
- Test your service by appending `/inventory` and `/inventory/{productID}` paths to the URL to verify the response.
  - **Note:** For the product URL, use the same product ID you used previously. The end of the URL should resemble `/inventory/12345`.
- To get the URL for the Cloud Run service inventory page, run the following command in Cloud Shell:
  ```bash
  export SVC_URL=$(gcloud run services describe hello-world \
    --project set at lab start \
    --region set at lab start \
    --platform managed \
    --format='value(status.url)')
  echo ${SVC_URL}/inventory
  ```
