# Prompt Design in Vertex AI

### What is Vertex AI?

Vertex AI is Google Cloud's unified machine learning (ML) platform that helps data scientists and ML engineers build, deploy, and scale machine learning models faster and more efficiently. It integrates various Google Cloud AI tools and services, allowing users to manage the entire ML lifecycle, from data preparation and model training to deployment and monitoring. Vertex AI provides a wide range of pre-built models, including those for natural language processing, computer vision, and generative AI, along with tools for creating custom models.

### Summary of the "Prompt Design in Vertex AI: Challenge Lab"

#### Overview
In this challenge lab, you are tasked with using Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform to develop tools for generating evocative product descriptions and catchy taglines for a marketing campaign. The lab focuses on applying generative AI techniques, particularly using the Gemini models in Vertex AI Studio, to achieve these goals.

#### Topics Tested
1. **Crafting Effective Prompts**: Design prompts and use parameters to guide generative AI output in Vertex AI Studio.
2. **Using Gemini Models**: Generate product descriptions and taglines for a real-world marketing scenario.
3. **Python Code Implementation**: Export and understand generative AI code from Vertex AI Studio.
4. **Jupyter Notebooks**: Test and modify generative AI code in a notebook environment.

### Challenge Scenario
You are working with an educational content startup that has partnered with Cymbal Direct, an online retailer launching a new outdoor gear line. Your task is to help Cymbal Direct create a marketing campaign using generative AI to produce:
- **Evocative Product Descriptions**: Descriptive text inspired by product images, focusing on the essence of the products and the feeling of being in nature.
- **Catchy Taglines**: Taglines that highlight product features, target audience, and desired emotional response.

### Task 1: Build a Gemini Image Analysis Tool
- **Objective**: Create a template for analyzing Cymbal Direct product images using the Gemini model in Vertex AI Studio.
- **Steps**:
  1. Download the provided image of a backpack on a trail.
  2. Use Vertex AI Studio's Multimodal interface with the `gemini-1.0-pro-vision` model to generate descriptive text options inspired by the image.
  3. Experiment with different prompts to generate:
     - Short, descriptive text.
     - Catchy phrases suitable for advertisements.
     - Poetic descriptions for a nature-focused campaign.
  4. Name the prompt "Cymbal Product Analysis" and save it.

### Task 2: Build a Gemini Tagline Generator
- **Objective**: Create a structured prompt for generating diverse tagline options using the Gemini language model in Vertex AI Studio.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use the `gemini-1.0-pro` model in the Language interface.
  2. Design a structured prompt with parameters for customizing taglines based on:
     - Product attributes (e.g., durable, lightweight).
     - Target audience (e.g., young adventurers, families).
     - Emotional resonance (e.g., empowered, connected).
  3. Provide a context for the model, describing the partnership between Cymbal Direct and the outdoor gear retailer.
  4. Include two example inputs and outputs to guide the model's output.
  5. Test the prompt with different inputs and iterate on the prompt to refine the tagline generation.
  6. Name the prompt "Cymbal Tagline Generator Template" and save it.

### Task 3: Experiment with Image Analysis Code
- **Objective**: Explore and modify the Python code for the image analysis prompt you created.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open the `generative-ai-jupyterlab` notebook in Vertex AI Workbench and create a new notebook file named `image-analysis.ipynb`.
  2. Retrieve the code for the "Cymbal Product Analysis" prompt and run it in the notebook.
  3. Modify the image analysis prompt within the code to produce shorter and more creative descriptions.
  4. Adjust parameters to encourage the model to generate unusual and unexpected descriptions.
  5. Save and rerun the code to verify the output meets the new specifications.

### Task 4: Experiment with Tagline Generation Code
- **Objective**: Explore and modify the Python code for the tagline generation prompt.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create a new notebook file named `tagline-generator.ipynb`.
  2. Add the provided code template to the notebook, inserting your example inputs and outputs from the "Cymbal Tagline Generator Template" prompt.
  3. Modify the last input in the prompt to include a specific keyword (e.g., "nature").
  4. Save and rerun the code to test the model with the new prompt.
  5. Verify that the new tagline includes the specified keyword.

### Conclusion
This lab challenges you to apply your knowledge of Vertex AI and generative AI by crafting prompts, experimenting with models, and modifying Python code to meet specific marketing goals. By completing these tasks, you enhance your ability to design and implement effective AI-driven solutions in real-world scenarios.
