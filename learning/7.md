# Gemini For Cloud Architects

**In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:**


- Enable Gemini
- Explore various Google services that you can use to deploy an app to GKE by asking Gemini context-based questions.
- Prompt Gemini to provide commands that you can use to deploy a basic app to a GKE cluster.
- Create, explore, and modify the GKE cluster by using Gemini to explain and generate the shell commands.

### Provision Cloud Infrastructure with Gemini

**Task 1. Enable Gemini**
- Click on the Cloud Shell icon in the top-right corner of the Google Cloud console toolbar.
- Set your project ID and region environment variables by running:
  ```bash
  PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
  REGION=lab region
  echo "PROJECT_ID=${PROJECT_ID}"
  echo "REGION=${REGION}"
  ```
  **Note:** Note the region as it may differ from the sample prompts.
- Store the signed-in Google user account in an environment variable:
  ```bash
  USER=$(gcloud config get-value account 2> /dev/null)
  echo "USER=${USER}"
  ```
- Click `Authorize` if prompted.
- Enable the Cloud AI Companion API for Gemini:
  ```bash
  gcloud services enable cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com --project ${PROJECT_ID}
  ```
- Grant the necessary IAM roles to your Google Cloud Qwiklabs user account:
  ```bash
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member user:${USER} --role=roles/cloudaicompanion.user
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_ID} --member user:${USER} --role=roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageViewer
  ```
  **Note:** Adding these roles lets the user use Gemini assistance.

**Task 2. Deploy GKE clusters**
- Return to your tab with the Google Cloud console.
- Refresh the Google Cloud console page.
- Click on the Gemini icon in the top-right corner of the Google Cloud console toolbar.
- Click the `Start Chatting` button.
- Enter the following prompt:
  ```
  How can I run Kubernetes on Google Cloud without having to own management of nodes and the control plane?
  ```
  **Note:** When constructing prompts for Gemini, provide as much detail and context as you would if asking a subject matter expert.
- Gemini should respond with:
  ```
  To run Kubernetes on Google Cloud without having to own management of nodes and the control plane, you can use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in Autopilot mode. In Autopilot mode, Google manages the control plane and system components for you, and also manages your worker nodes.
  ```
  **Note:** Gemini doesn't use your prompts or its responses as data to train its model. For more information, see How Gemini in Google Cloud uses your data.
- From Geminiâ€™s response, it looks like a GKE Autopilot cluster will meet the needs.

**Task 3. Deploy a GKE Autopilot cluster**
- Enter the following prompt in Gemini:
  ```
  How do I create a GKE Autopilot cluster?
  ```
- Gemini responds with instructions for creating a cluster using the Google Cloud console and the Google Cloud CLI.
- Refine the prompt with more detail:
  ```
  What is the command to create a GKE Autopilot cluster in my current project and in the lab region region named gemini-demo using the gcloud CLI?
  ```
- Gemini should respond with:
  ```bash
  gcloud container clusters create-auto gemini-demo --region lab region
  ```
- Click on the Cloud Shell icon in the Gemini toolbar.
- Paste and run the command in Cloud Shell.
  **Note:** Wait a few minutes for the cluster deployment to complete.
- Once complete, view the cluster details by navigating to Kubernetes Engine > Clusters and clicking on the cluster name `gemini-demo`.

**Task 4. Deploy a sample web application**
- With the GKE Autopilot cluster created, deploy a sample web application.
- Enter the following prompt in Gemini:
  ```
  What is the kubectl command to create a deployment called hello-server for the image us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0?
  ```
- Gemini responds with:
  ```bash
  kubectl create deployment hello-server --image=us-docker.pkg.dev/google-samples/containers/gke/hello-app:1.0
  ```
- Run the command in Cloud Shell.
- To provision a load balancer in front of the web server, enter the following prompt in Gemini:
  ```
  What is the kubectl command to expose this deployment on port 80 and target port 8080 with a load balancer?
  ```
- Gemini responds with:
  ```bash
  kubectl expose deployment hello-server --type LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080
  ```
- Run the command in Cloud Shell.
- To see the external IP address associated with the load balancer, enter:
  ```
  What is the kubectl command to see the external IP address associated with this load balancer?
  ```
- Gemini responds with:
  ```bash
  kubectl get service hello-server
  ```
- Run the command in Cloud Shell.
- After a few minutes, the output should show the external IP address. Open another browser tab and navigate to the external IP address to see the `hello-app` running.
